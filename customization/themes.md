Scyllascope supports custom color themes. You can create your own theme and it will appear in the [Menu → Theme](/header/menu#theme) list automatically — no need to reload the plugin.

## Getting started

1. Open **Menu → Theme → Open Themes Folder**.
2. Inside you will find `mytheme.json.example` — a ready-made template.
3. Copy it and save with a `.json` extension, e.g. `mycooltheme.json`.
4. Edit the colors to your liking and save the file.
5. The theme will appear in the Theme menu right away.

## Online Editor

You can also use the [Theme Editor](https://scyllascope-theme-editor.dsgdnb.com/) to create and preview themes visually in your browser.
