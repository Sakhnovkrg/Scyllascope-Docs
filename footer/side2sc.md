# Side2SC

Displays the side signal as an overlay on top of the main waveform. The side signal is derived from the stereo difference (Left minus Right) and is routed to the sidechain display, emulating a sidechain input.

This is useful for monitoring the stereo content of your mix — if the side signal is too loud relative to the main waveform, your mix may have excessive stereo width or phase issues. If it's barely visible, the signal is close to mono. Combined with [BP](/footer/bp), you can isolate the low end and see how much side content is there — and whether it introduces phase cancellation.
