# Gain

![Gain](/images/07.webp)

A visual gain control that scales the waveform display without affecting the actual audio output.

- **Increase** to zoom into quiet signals for better analysis.
- **Decrease** to see headroom around 0 dB. Any part of the waveform that exceeds 0 dB will be highlighted, making it easy to spot clipping.

::: tip Shortcut
You can adjust the gain with [[Ctrl]] + [[Mouse Wheel]] (on macOS: [[⌘ Cmd]] + [[Mouse Wheel]]).
