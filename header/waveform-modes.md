# Waveform Modes

## Spectral

Enables frequency-based color coding on the waveform. The spectrum is divided into 5 bands — sub, low, mid, high, and air — with colors blending smoothly between them. The colors are defined by the current theme.

## AA (Anti-Aliasing)

Smooths the waveform edges for a cleaner look.

::: tip Performance
Disabling Spectral and AA can improve performance on slower machines. Some users may also prefer the classic, unprocessed waveform look.
