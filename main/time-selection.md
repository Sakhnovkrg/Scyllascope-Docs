# Time Selection

![Time Selection](/images/13.gif)

Select a region of the waveform by holding [[Ctrl]] + **Drag** (on macOS: [[⌘ Cmd]] + **Drag**). You can resize the selection by dragging its edges, and click outside to deselect. All measurements update in real time.

The selection overlay shows the following:

- **Time** — duration of the selected region in milliseconds.
- **Peak** — the highest sample value in the selection, in dB.
- **RMS** — Root Mean Square level, representing the perceived loudness of the selection.
- **Crest** — the difference between Peak and RMS in dB. A high crest factor means the signal has sharp transients relative to its average level. A low crest factor means the signal is more compressed or saturated.
