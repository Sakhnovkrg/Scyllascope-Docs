# Context Menu

![Context Menu](/images/15.webp)

Right-click on the waveform area to open the context menu.

## Source

Selects the audio source for the current instance — **Left**, **Right**, **Mid**, or **Peak**. Works the same as [Default Source](/header/menu#default-source) in the main menu, but applies only to this instance.

## Rename

Instances can be renamed for easier identification. In the VST3 version, the name is automatically taken from the DAW track name.

## Use Track Name

When enabled, the instance name stays in sync with the DAW track name. If you rename the track, the instance name updates automatically.

## Instance Overlay

The lower section of the context menu controls how instances interact with each other — sidechain from instance, colorize, sum, and overlay selection. See [Instance Sidechain](/main/instance-overlay) for details.
